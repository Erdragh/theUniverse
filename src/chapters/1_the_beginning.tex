\section{The Beginning}

Now let's talk about how everything came to be. Since, you know, I'm God, I have utmost authority when speaking about the beginning of times.

Now, in another believed stroke of genius, some may say that everything came to be, because I fucked your mom. However, I'm God, so I have higher standards.

What actually happened, is that I just felt like torturing some innocent souls of the aether for existing, so I just made an endless place of torment to place them into.
This has backfired immensly though, because somehow, somewhy, some people believe that there's a way to salvation and that I love them and so on. I don't really know how the fuck
you'd think that, but you do you. Now I could end this paper here and have you conclude on your own that you're insignificant, because I obviously created you to torture you, but
I feel like shitting on you some more, so this is only \emph{the Beginning}.
