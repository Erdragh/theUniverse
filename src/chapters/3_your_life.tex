\section{Your Life}

Holy fuck, how did you even get this far? Your life has no meaning, you have no reason to exist. Why didn't you kill yourself already?
Well, since you're here anyways, I can prove to you how you existing does not add anything to the universe at all.
Let $a : \text{Person} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$, with 
$$a(x) = \text{number of meaningful achievemnts of } x$$
where $x \in \text{Person}$.

Now you might think that on a bell curve of intelligence, like the one shown in 
figure \ref{fig:bell-curve}, the graph plotting the average of 
$$a(x_1), a(x_2), \dotsc, a(x_{n-1}), a(x_n)$$
with $x_i \in \{x \in \text{Person } | \text{ IQ of } x \text{ is the current IQ}\}$ over the IQ, would resemble an exponential one, because
you'd think that the more intelligent someone was, the more they would achieve in their life. I would wager that the vast amount of people
think like this. However, it isn't true.

\end{figure}

Another thing you might think is that it could also behave like the bell curve itself. The reasoning behind it might be the conclusion that
once you become too intelligent, you overthink a lot and it prevents you from actually getting things done.

However, I'm here to tell you that it would probably rather look something like the graph shown in figure \ref{fig:graph-achievements}.
Why do I say that? Well, because no human being has ever achieved something meaningful. Nothing you or anybody else has ever done has
contributed something to the universe. And I'm certain of that, because I made it that way.

    \draw[->, gray, thick] (0, -1) -- (0, 1) node[anchor=south]{number $n \in \mathbb{N}$ of achievements};
    \filldraw[black] (0,0) circle (2pt) node[anchor=north east]{0};
    \draw[red, thin] (-5, 0) -- (5, 0) node[anchor=north]{$a$};
